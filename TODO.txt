(A) Implement timers update.

(A) Implement sound support.

(B) jp: return an error if the jump is pointing to the interpreter reserved
    memory section (0x0-0x200-1).

(B) test_jump: Catch errors from the jp function.

(B) jp_v0_addr: return an error if the jump v[0]+nnn goes out of bounds
    ([0x0-0x200-1] and > [0xfff-...]).

(B) test_jump_plus_v0: Catch errors from jp_v0_addr.

(B) call: return an error if trying to call a function when the stack pointer
    is 0xf+1, caused by a previous call. It will cause stack overflow.

(B) call: return an error if the the call function recieves as a paremeter
      an address < 0x200 (reserved interpreter memory section).

(B) test_call_subroutine: Catch errors from the call function.

(B) ret: return a error when the stack pointer is zero and the return 
    instruction is executed (There is no address to recover from the stack).

(B) test_return_from_subroutine: Catch errors from ret.
