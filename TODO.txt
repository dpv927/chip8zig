x Make and pass tests for Keypad Input.
x Make and pass tests for functions using the I Register.
x Check if the Sprites array contains the correct elements.
x Make and pass tests for Binary-Coded Decimal function (bcd).

x Fix Drawing Sprites to the Screen.
x Implement timers update.
x Implement sound support.
x jp: return an error if the jump is pointing to the interpreter reserved memory section (0x0-0x200-1).
x jp_v0_addr: return an error if the jump v[0]+nnn goes out of bounds ([0x0-0x200-1] and > [0xfff-...]).
x call: return an error if trying to call a function when the stack pointer is 0xf+1, caused by a previous call. It will cause stack overflow.
x call: return an error if the the call function recieves as a paremeter an address < 0x200 (reserved interpreter memory section).
x ret: return a error when the stack pointer is zero and the return instruction is executed (There is no address to recover from the stack).
x test_jump: Catch errors from the jp function.
x test_jump_plus_v0: Catch errors from jp_v0_addr.
x test_call_subroutine: Catch errors from the call function.
x test_return_from_subroutine: Catch errors from ret.

(B) Make a function only for updating the timers
(B) Make a function to draw the display.
(B) Get the file path from a parameter.

(C) Change the path of the sound if the program is installed or not.
